This profile will create a site suitable for testing patches for Drupal.org. It
is based on the development profile.

The code I stole from development profile:
* Will install devel and devel_node_access along the default nodes.
* Creates users and content+comments as well with the devel package generate
scripts.
* Creates uid 1 user with "a" as username and password and logs it in.
